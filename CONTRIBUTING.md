### Welcome

We're excited you want to contribute to the Arkyide project! Your help will make it even greater and more useful for everyone. We encourage you to join our Discord community to chat about the project: https://discord.gg/83TzFGhY

## Getting Started

Before diving in, please set up your development environment following the instructions in our `README.md` file.

## How to Contribute

Here's a general workflow to guide your contributions:

1. **Fork the repository:** Create your own copy of the project on GitHub.
2. **Create a new branch:** This will allow you to work on your changes without affecting the main project codebase.
3. **Create an issue (optional):** If you're addressing a specific bug or proposing a new feature, describe it in an issue on: https://github.com/AYLIT-crew/Arkyide/issues
4. **Work on your contribution:**
    - You can contribute by solving existing issues or creating new ones based on your ideas.
    - Make code modifications as needed.
5. **Submit a pull request:** Once your changes are ready, submit a pull request to propose them to the main project codebase.

## Writing Issue Guidelines

To help us keep track of issues effectively, please follow these guidelines when submitting them:

**Format:**

`[TYPE - id] - Short Description`

**Explanation:**

- **TYPE:** Choose a category that best describes your issue:
    - `FIXME` - Minor bugs, major bugs, and side effect fixes.
    - `TODO` - New feature planned for future implementation.
    - `IDEA` - Any thought or suggestion you'd like to share in detail.
    - `ENHANCEMENT` - Upgrade or modification to an existing feature.
    - `DOCUMENTATION` - Request for new documentation or fixes/todos related to existing documentation.
    - `REFACTOR` - Request to improve code structure without changing functionality.
- **id:** A unique number to track the issue (e.g., 001, 002, 003).
- **Short Description:** A clear and concise description of the issue in plain text.

**Example:**

`[IDEA - 001] - System to track our todos, bug fixes, and much more!`
